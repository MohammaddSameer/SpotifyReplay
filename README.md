# Spotify Replay

Spotify Replay is a Python-based application that interacts with the Spotify API and JSON files to provide insights into your listening history on Spotify over the past year. It allows you to explore and visualize your top songs and artists by play count or total listening time. You can also search for specific songs or artists within your listening history.
